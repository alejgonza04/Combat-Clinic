# About
This project was created out of my love of martial arts and programming. After me and my training partners realized there was no efficient way to track our progress and training sessions over time, I decided to create a solution. I set out to create a web application that could:
- Allow us to track our progress and sessions
- Give us analytics of our training data
- Teach us new techniques through videos
