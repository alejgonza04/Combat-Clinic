# About
This project was created out of my love of martial arts and programming. After me and my training partners realized there was no efficient way to track our progress and training sessions over time, I decided to create a solution. I set out to create a web application that could:
- Allow us to track our progress and sessions
- Give us analytics of our training data
- Teach us new techniques through videos

### Features
# Overview
Combat Clinic aids practitioners in their venture by enabling them to track their progress along the way. By adding their training sessions, they get access to real-time graph analytics of their training hours and martial arts distribution. Additionally, practitioners will have access to a diverse library of technique breakdown videos across various disciplines such as BJJ, Muay Thai, Boxing, and Wrestling. This intuitive approach allows them to visualize their progress, serving as motivation, accountability, and guidance.
