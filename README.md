# About
This project was created out of my love for martial arts and programming. After my training partners and I realized there was no efficient way to track our progress and training sessions over time, I decided to create a solution. I set out to create a web application that could:
- Allow us to track our progress and sessions
- Provide analytics of our training data
- Teach us new techniques through videos

# Features
### Overview
Combat Clinic aids practitioners in their martial arts journey by enabling them to track their progress. By adding their training sessions, they get access to real-time graph analytics of their training hours and martial arts distribution. Additionally, practitioners have access to a diverse library of technique breakdown videos across various disciplines such as BJJ, Muay Thai, Boxing, and Wrestling. This intuitive approach allows them to visualize their progress, serving as motivation, accountability, and guidance.

- Users are able to create an account that links their progress and session data with their email, stored on a MongoDB database.

# Dashboard

- From here, users can add a session, view their sessions, or look at their session data analytics.
- Users also get to view their total training time, sparring time, and total days training.

# Add Session

- Users are able to add important information from their training sessions, such as what discipline they trained in, how long it was, what techniques they used, how long they sparred, and what day they did it.

# Graph and Chart Data of Progress

- The bar graph shows users their training hours over a span of dates.
- The pie chart shows the user the number of hours they trained each discipline.
- This vizualization aids users in their journey as they get to see how many hours they are training each day and what disciplines they should prioritize for balance.

# Sessions

- An overview of all user session data is laid out and organized by date.

# Technique Breakdown Videos

- Users can select a discipline pick from a plethora of in-depth technique breakdown videos explained by professional and experienced martial artists.
- This gives the user an opportunity to train, practice, and learn outside of the gym, elevating their game for next time they come to training.

# Project Use
- This project is a non-profit free to use website meant to help the martial arts community. It was shared with practitioners online and fellow training partners at my local gym.
- With 50+ registered users, practitioners consistently praise the website for its usefulness in visualizing their progress and enhancing their learning experience.

# Future Development
- This is my first startup, and I am planning on updating the website based on user feedback as well as expanding it to other martial art disciplines.
